Get vexed! A very simple Shiny app that presents a random (emoji) flag. Click to reveal the nation it represents.

Basically, I wanted something interesting to open with each new browser tab on my phone.

The app is live online at [shinyapps.io/mattdray/randoflag](https://www.shinyapps.io/mattdray/randoflag), until I decide to take it down. 

You can always run the app from an R session with:

``` r
shiny::runGitHub(
  repo = "randoflag", 
  username = "matt-dray",
  ref = "main"
)
```
